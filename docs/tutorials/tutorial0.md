# Tutorial 0 - Introduction to Janis

Welcome to the introduction for Janis! This tutorial introduces Janis and installs it on your local computer, ready for building your first workflow.

Janis is workflow framework that uses Python to construct a declarative workflow. It has a simple workflow API within Python that you use to declare your workflow. Janis can convert your pipeline to the Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Workflow Description Language (WDL) for execution, but it's also great for publishing and archiving.

Janis was designed with a few priorities:

- Workflows should be easy to build/
- Workflows and tools must be easily shared (portable).
- Execution must be able to occur on HPCs and cloud environments.
- Workflows should be reproducible and re-runnable.

Janis uses an *abstracted execution environment*, which removes the shared file system in favour of you specifiying all the files you need up front and passing them around as a File object. This allows the same workflow to be executable on your local machine, HPCs and cloud, and we let the `execution engine` handle moving our files. This also means that we can use file systems like ``S3``, ``GCS``, ``FTP`` and more without any code changes.

> Instructions for setting up Janis on a compute cluster are under construction. 

## Requirements

- Local environment
- Python 3.6+
- Docker

## Installing Janis

We'll install Janis in a virtual environment as it preserves versioning of Janis in a reproducible way.

1. Create and activate the virtualenv:

    ```bash
    # create virtual env
	virtualenv -p python3 ~/janis/env
	# source the virtual env
	source ~/janis/env/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install Janis through PIP:

    ```bash
    pip install janis-pipelines
    ```

3. Test that janis was installed:

    ```bash
	janis -v
	# --------------------  -------
    # janis-core            v0.7.3
    # janis-assistant       v0.7.10
    # janis-unix            v0.7.0
    # janis-bioinformatics  v0.7.1
    # --------------------  -------
	```
	
### Installing CWLTool

[CWLTool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) is a reference workflow engine for the Common Workflow Language. Janis can run your workflow using CWLTool and collect the results. For more information about which engines Janis supports, visit the [Engine Support](https://janis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references/engines.html) page.

```bash
pip install cwltool
```

Test that CWLTool has installed correctly with:

```bash
cwltool --version
# .../bin/cwltool 1.0.20190906054215
```


## Running an example workflow with Janis

You can test run an example workflow with Janis and CWLTool with the following command:

```bash
janis run --engine cwltool hello
```

You'll be presented with the progress screen as your workflow completes. Some things to note:

- `WID` - the janis identifier of your workflow.
- `Task Dir` - Where your workflow, output files and logs are.
- 

```
WID:        df5daa
EngId:      df5daa
Name:       hello
Engine:     cwltool

Task Dir:   $HOME/janis/hello/20191115_105042_df5daa/
Exec Dir:   None

Status:     Completed
Duration:   6s
Start:      2019-11-14T23:50:42.940196+00:00
Finish:     2019-11-14T23:50:48.453133+00:00
Updated:    Just now (2019-11-14T23:50:53+00:00)

Jobs: 
    [âœ“] hello (2s)       

Outputs:
    - out: $HOME/janis/execution/hello/20191115_105042_df5daa/output/out
```

There is a single output `out` from the workflow, cat-ing this result we get:

```bash
cat $HOME/janis/execution/hello/20191115_105042_df5daa/output/out
# Hello, World
```

### Overriding an input

The workflow `hello` has one input `inp`. We can override this input by passing `--inp $value` onto the end of our run statement, eg:

```bash
janis run --engine cwltool hello --inp "Hello, yourname"
# out: Hello, yourname
```


## Summary

- Setup a virtualenv
- Installed Janis and CWLTool
- Ran a small workflow with custom inputs

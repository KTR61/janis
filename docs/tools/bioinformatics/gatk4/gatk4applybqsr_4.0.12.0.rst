Tool documentation
******************
Apply base quality score recalibration: This tool performs the second pass in a two-stage 
process called Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR). Specifically, it recalibrates the 
base qualities of the input reads based on the recalibration table produced by the 
BaseRecalibrator tool, and outputs a recalibrated BAM or CRAM file.

Summary of the BQSR procedure: The goal of this procedure is to correct for systematic bias 
that affect the assignment of base quality scores by the sequencer. The first pass consists 
of calculating error empirically and finding patterns in how error varies with basecall 
features over all bases. The relevant observations are written to a recalibration table. 
The second pass consists of applying numerical corrections to each individual basecall 
based on the patterns identified in the first step (recorded in the recalibration table) 
and write out the recalibrated data to a new BAM or CRAM file.

- This tool replaces the use of PrintReads for the application of base quality score 
    recalibration as practiced in earlier versions of GATK (2.x and 3.x).
- You should only run ApplyBQSR with the covariates table created from the input BAM or CRAM file(s).
- Original qualities can be retained in the output file under the "OQ" tag if desired. 
    See the `--emit-original-quals` argument for details.

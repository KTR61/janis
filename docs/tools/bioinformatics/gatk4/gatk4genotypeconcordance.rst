GenotypeConcordance (Picard)
            
Calculates the concordance between genotype data of one samples in each of two VCFs - one being 
considered the truth (or reference) the other being the call. The concordance is broken into 
separate results sections for SNPs and indels. Statistics are reported in three different files.

Summary
    Calculates the concordance between genotype data of one samples in each of two VCFs - one being 
    considered the truth (or reference) the other being the call. The concordance is broken into 
    separate results sections for SNPs and indels. Summary and detailed statistics are reported.

Details
    This tool evaluates the concordance between genotype calls for a sample in different callsets
    where one is being considered as the "truth" (aka standard, or reference) and the other as the 
    "call" that is being evaluated for accuracy. The Comparison can be restricted to a confidence 
    interval which is typically used in order to enable proper assessment of False Positives and 
    the False-Positive Rate (FPR).
 
Output Metrics:
    Output metrics consists of GenotypeConcordanceContingencyMetrics, GenotypeConcordanceSummaryMetrics, 
    and GenotypeConcordanceDetailMetrics. For each set of metrics, the data is broken into separate 
    sections for SNPs and INDELs. Note that only SNP and INDEL variants are considered, MNP, Symbolic, 
    and Mixed classes of variants are not included.

    GenotypeConcordanceContingencyMetrics enumerate the constituents of each contingent in a callset 
    including true-positive (TP), true-negative (TN), false-positive (FP), and false-negative (FN) calls.
    GenotypeConcordanceDetailMetrics include the numbers of SNPs and INDELs for each contingent genotype 
    as well as the number of validated genotypes.

    GenotypeConcordanceSummaryMetrics provide specific details for the variant caller performance 
    on a callset including values for sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values.


Useful definitions applicable to alleles and genotypes:
    - Truthset - A callset (typically in VCF format) containing variant calls and genotypes that have been 
        cross-validated with multiple technologies e.g. Genome In A Bottle Consortium (GIAB) (https://sites.stanford.edu/abms/giab)
    - TP - True-positives are variant sites that match against the truth-set
    - FP - False-positives are reference sites miscalled as variant
    - FN - False-negatives are variant sites miscalled as reference
    - TN - True-negatives are correctly called as reference
    - Validated genotypes - are TP sites where the exact genotype (HET or HOM-VAR) appears in the truth-set

VCF Output:
    - The concordance state will be stored in the CONC_ST tag in the INFO field
    - The truth sample name will be "truth" and call sample name will be "call"

Resulting files will be:(1) .genotype_concordance_summary_metrics, (2) .genotype_concordance_detail_metrics, (3) .genotype_concordance_contingency_metrics.
argumentsFile               Optional<Array<File>>  --arguments_file                 10  read one or more arguments files and add them to the command line

ignoreFilterStatus          Optional<Boolean>      --IGNORE_FILTER_STATUS               Default is false. If true, filter status of sites will be ignored so that we include filtered sites when calculating genotype concordance.
intersectIntervals          Optional<Boolean>      --INTERSECT_INTERVALS                If true, multiple interval lists will be intersected. If false multiple lists will be unioned.

Useful when hom ref sites are left out of the truth set. This flag can only be used with a high confidence interval list.
outputAllRows               Optional<Boolean>      --OUTPUT_ALL_ROWS                    If true, output all rows in detailed statistics even when count == 0. When false only output rows with non-zero counts.

createIndex                 Optional<Boolean>      --CREATE_INDEX                   11  Whether to create a BAM index when writing a coordinate-sorted BAM file.

maxRecordsInRam             Optional<Integer>      --MAX_RECORDS_IN_RAM             11  When writing SAM files that need to be sorted, this will specify the number of records stored in RAM before spilling to disk. Increasing this number reduces the number of file handles needed to sort a SAM file, and increases the amount of RAM needed.

Setting stringency to SILENT can improve performance when processing a BAM file in which variable-length data (read, qualities, tags) do not otherwise need to be decoded.The --VALIDATION_STRINGENCY argument is an enumerated type (ValidationStringency), which can have one of the following values: [STRICT, LENIENT, SILENT]
verbosity                   Optional<String>       --verbosity                      11  The --verbosity argument is an enumerated type (LogLevel), which can have one of the following values: [ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG]

Filename
========



Documentation
-------------

This class is a placeholder for generated filenames, by default it is optional and CAN be overrided, 
however the program has been structured in a way such that these names will be generated based on the step label. 
These should only be used when the tool _requires_ a filename to output and you aren't 
concerned what the filename should be. The Filename DataType should NOT be used as an output.

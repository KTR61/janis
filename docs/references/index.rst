Framework Documentation
=======================


There are two major components to constructing workflows,
building tools and assembling workflows. For this reason
we split the reference documentation into two major components:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   workflow
   commandtool


Supported translations:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   cwl
   wdl
